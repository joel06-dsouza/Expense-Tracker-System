# Expense-Tracker-System
In our daily lives we are so busy that we are not able to know how and when our money gets spent. With the help of this project we are able to keep a track of all of our expenses. The user just needs to enter the type of item, item name, date of purchase and lastly the price of item.  The project gives the option to add new items by just clicking on the add new item. To update the item, we just need to double click on the item. A small window gets opened where you can just change the item name, item type and item price. No option is given to change the date of purchase. To delete the item, we need to select the item first and then we have to click on the delete item button. By using this system we are able to keep the track of daily expenses easily and make life easy.
